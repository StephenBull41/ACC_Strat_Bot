# ACC_Strat_Bot
Auto setup editor for ACC to set tyre pressures


How to use:
1. Create a setup in game, get it to where you like the car
2. test the setup at 3 different temperatures, one low, one mid and one high, make a note of the track temp
3. record what cold tyre pressures give you an ideal hot tyre pressure at each temp
4. set the first 3 pit stratergies to match these pressures(cold/mid/high)
5. run the script & follow prompts
6. load the setup in game

# Important Notes

the script will create a new setup with "auto_" prefixed on the name
e.g you edit setup "race test 35c opt" the new setup will be named "auto_race test 35c opt"

the first 25 pit stratergies will have their tyre pressures set

each setup number is for a 20c + n track temp

e.g setup 1 is for a 21c track, setup 6 is for a 26c track, setup 14 is for a 34c track

setups will be created up to #25 for a 45c track(never seen ACC go this high)

Setups will not have any other setting edited from what they were already set has

Brake pads / fuel load / tyre compound will remain unchanged
